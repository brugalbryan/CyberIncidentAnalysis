# Analyzing the Data with the help of R
**In this project, I'll look into the most common cybersecurity breaches in the United States between 2007 and 2014.**

**The purpose of analyzing this historical data set is to gain a better understanding of cyber breaches and how they affect both the targeted organizations and the individuals they serve.**


**This data set is important because it can assist us in determining the attacker's objectives. Knowing their motivations can help businesses in understanding what needs to be protected. It also gives us a sense of what attackers are capable of and what they'll go after once they've gained access to the target network.**
